/*
 * The processor and its L2 cache cause the icswx instruction to
 * generate a COP_REQ transaction on PowerBus. The transaction has no
 * address, and the processor does not perform an MMU access to
 * authenticate the transaction. The command portion of the PowerBus
 * COP_REQ transaction includes the LPAR_ID (LPID) and the coprocessor
 * Process ID (PID), which the coprocessor compares to the authorized
 * LPID and PID held in the coprocessor, to determine if the process
 * is authorized to generate the transaction.  The data of the COP_REQ
 * transaction is cache block or less, typically 64 or 128 bytes in
 * size, and is placed in cacheable memory on a 128-byte boundary
 * _always_.
 *
 * The task to use a coprocessor should use use_cop() mark the use of
 * the coprocessor type (CT) and context swithing.  On a server
 * processor the PID register is used only for coprocessor management
 * and so a coprocessor PID is allocated before executing icswx
 * instruction. Drop_cop() is used to free the resources created by
 * use_cop().
 *
 * Example:
 * Host Fabric Interface (HFI) is a PowerPC network coprocessor.
 * Each HFI have multiple windows. Each HFI window serves as a
 * network device sending to and receiving from HFI network.
 * HFI immediate send function uses icswx instruction. The immediate
 * send function allows small (single cache-line) packets be sent
 * without using the regular HFI send FIFO and doorbell, which are
 * much slower than immediate send.
 *
 * For each task intending to use HFI immediate send, the HFI driver
 * calls use_cop() to obtain a coprocessor PID for the task.
 * The HFI driver then allocate a free HFI window and save the
 * coprocessor PID to the HFI window to allow the task to use the
 * HFI window.
 *
 * The HFI driver repeatedly creates immediate send packets and
 * issues icswx instruction to send data through the HFI window.
 * The HFI compares the coprocessor PID in the CPU PID register
 * to the PID held in the HFI window to determine if the transaction
 * is allowed.
 *
 * When the task to release the HFI window, the HFI driver calls
 * drop_cop() to release the coprocessor PID.
